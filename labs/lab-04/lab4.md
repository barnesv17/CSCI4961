##### 2. Read the four criteria for Free Software
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.   
##### 3. Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choosing a license provides clear communication between the developers and users. This clear communication ensures protection. Without a license, open source code can easily fall under default copyright laws. This means that the developer has rights to all source code and noone else can reproduce, distribute, or add to it. This ultimately defeats the purpose of "Open Source Software."
##### 4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To eloborate further from the last question, a project without a license can be considered to be under default copyright laws. This means ONLY the developer can reproduce, adapt, and distribute the source code. Using this kind of project can lead to legal trouble.
##### 5. Read the Failure to follow the Open Syste Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with this claim. Gopher had the opportunity for a huge communnity of users to make the improvements they wanted to see to the code. Placing the burden of keeping up with competitors on only a few developers who are most likely doing it with extrinsic motivation is not efficient compared to a community of users working with intrinsic motivation.
##### 6. Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and its kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.
##### Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linux was first released by Linus Torvalds. Linus' parents were campus radicals and Linus belonged to the Swedish-speaking minority of Finland. Therefore, you can see an early influence of activism and conscientious objection to proprietary establishments early on in his life. Futhermore, Linus was heavily influenced by Richard Stallman, a significant free software movement activist. Therefore, it is clear why Linus Torvald would choose the GPL v2 license.
##### 7. As a table, make up an open source project and a business model that you could use to make money from it.
* Pick a license that fits your business model using the LICENSE chooser by Github.     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our group chose the GNU General Public License license
* Document this project with a README file describing the project, what the business model is, the license you would choose and why.
* Create a repository for the project on github and select the license you decided on. Make all of your table collaborators. Link to the repository

##### 8. Take 5 projects from Observatory or past RCOS Projects and create a table for which project has which license.
