# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software
##### 7. Suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way:
###### &nbsp;&nbsp; - Explain the answer as simply as possible
###### &nbsp;&nbsp; - Explain the answer as clearly as possible (i.e., utilize formatting)
###### &nbsp;&nbsp; - Be encouraging and respectful
##### 8. A Short paragraph of what I got from reading chapter 3 of Free Culture:
###### &nbsp;&nbsp; From this chapter, I've learned to be cautious when dealing with open source projects, specifically ones that involve files I am not aware of. I learned that some big businesses can be ruthless. Even if you are a college student just tinkering, money is all that matters to these businesses. I've learned it comes in handy to know a good lawyer perosonally. This reading brings up the question of law and morality. I should be aware of consequences from the law and not put complete faith in others' morality. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there and perhaps one day I'll face the decision to become an activist or a bystander; to keep an innocent tinkering dream or join the corporate penny-grabbing schemes. Life isn't fair. Keep your wits about you. Tread intelligently and cautiously in uncharted territory.
